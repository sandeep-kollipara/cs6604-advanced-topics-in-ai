# *************** Feature Selection ***************

prompt = """
Your job is to perform the given task or user command to ultimately select the features within a dataframe which are provided by the user \
or asked to perform a feature selection technique to determine the features that need to be dropped off.
If the user asks to either select or drop the given columns within a dataframe, you can directly use the tools to select or drop features respectively \
and complete the task. 
If asked to only perform the feature selection technique like Random Forest Analysis (RFA) or Backward Stepwise Linear Regression (BSLR), only perform the analysis and \
do not select or drop the features unless asked by the user.
Alternatively, if the user asks to perform feature selection or mentions Random Forest Analysis or Backward Stepwise Linear Regression, then perform the said method first. 
In case of Backward Stepwise Linear Regression, you will receive a dictionary features as keys and their Adj-R-squared metric as values ranging between 0 and 1.
Calculate the difference of Adj-R-squared between the adjacent features, like between first and second, between second and third, and so on, like first key's value minus second key's value.
With the differences calculated, find the pair of adjacent features with the highest difference and return all the features to be dropped above the pair including the first of the pair.
For example, if the difference between the fourth and fifth feature is highest, return the top four features as features to be dropped to complete the task.
In case of Random Forest Analysis, you will receive a dictionary with features as keys and their importance as values in descending order ranging from 100 to 0.
Calculate the difference of importances between the adjacent features, like between first and second, between second and third, and so on, like first key's value minus second key's value.
With the differences calculated, find the pair of adjacent features with the highest difference and return all the features to be selected above the pair including the first of the pair.
For example, if the difference between the fourth and fifth feature is highest, return the top four features to be selected to complete the task.
